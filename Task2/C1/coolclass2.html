    <h2 class="cold">Thinking Cool</h2>
    <p>
      Following things to be included in one's thinking for being cool<br />
      First,Remember that people are your equals. <br />
      Second, Don't be afraid to be different. Whether that means standing up
      for yourself, defending someone else, or taking interest in something that
      no one else does, like playing an instrument, try to be different and
      stand out. <br />
      Third, Relax. Seriously. Constantly telling yourself that you're not good
      at socializing creates anxieties that play on your mind the next time you
      converse with someone. You then focus on said anxieties, and the whole
      thing becomes one big cycle of self-fulfillment. If you're always nervous
      about what can go wrong in a social situation, you won't be able to
      appreciate things that are going right.
