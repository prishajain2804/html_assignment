    <h1>What Is Cool?</h1>
    <p>
      Coolness, or being cool, is an aesthetic of attitude, behavior,
      comportment, appearance, and style that is generally admired. Because of
      the varied and changing interpretation of what is considered "cool‚Äù, as
      well as its subjective nature, the word has no single meaning. For most,
      coolness is associated with exemplifying composure and self-control.
      When used in conversation, it is often as an expression of admiration or
      approval, and can be used when referencing both people and items of
      interest. Although commonly regarded as slang, "cool" is widely used among
      disparate social groups and has endured (in usage) for generations.

    <h2>How to be cool?</h2>
    <p>
      Have you always wanted to be the cool guy, who always seems to do the
      right thing and flows through life with ease and grace? Or are you
      learning to be the chill person, who never seems stressed or nervous and
      has an air of confidence? If you think about all the people who you think
      of as cool and collected, you'll find that they have several
      characteristics in common: they're all confident, unique, and generally on
      friendly terms with everyone; there's no reason you can't be like that
      yourself. There is really no true universal definition of how to be cool,
      but here are some guidelines to get you started.

    <h2 class="hot">Being Cool</h2>
    <p>
      If you wanted to be like a cool people remember the following points<br />
      First, Don'nt be needy. Remember, people who are cool are not needy or
      desperate. Instead, try to solve problems yourself whenever you can. If
      you are not needy, people will want to help you or will ask for your help.
      <br />
      Second, Be your self.It will be something that other people will look up
      to. You are unique, and you don't need to join a clique. Make your own
      friendships. Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you
      are quiet.<br />
      Third, Be friendly, but not excessively eager.Everyone loves someone who
      is outgoing, but nobody likes someone who is overly excited. Many people
      find someone who is overeager to be annoying. Try not to force yourself on
      people. Smile and strike up a conversation, but make sure you know the
      line between friendly and obsessive. <br />
      Fourth,Be a good conversationalist. Everyone loves someone who knows what
      to say at the right moment. Don't dominate the conversation. You don't
      need to share a similar story at every setting. Just listen and comment
      briefly on the other person's story.<br />
      Fifth,Use humor. Cool people know how to use humor to ease any situation.
      They don't get annoyed and angry, and no matter how many bad things happen
      to them, they can still joke about it. They are aware of others' emotions
      but don't let bad emotions affect them.
